# Weather Lounge

## The Concept
Weather Lounge is an attempt at 'gamifying' the weather!

## Features
1. Weather recall
2. Dynamic sky that changes based on time of day - including sunrise and sunset transitions
3. Interactive weather themes, including rain and snow
4. Rain and thunderstorm sound effects
5. Interactive tools - including an umbrella to block rain, a heater to melt 'frost' and a torch to light up the night sky

## Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Icons from Skycons
5. Data from OpenWeather API
6. Deployed on Vercel

## Potential Future Roadmap
1. Adding a system to allow rain to create an interactive 'flood' effect and for snow to build up as well.
2. A bucket tool to scoop water and/or snow.
3. More background scenes that could change on weather conditions or the location of the forecast.
